          <h3>MONKEYS</h3>
          <p>
            As apes have emerged in the monkey group as sister of the old world
            monkeys, characteristics that describe monkeys are generally shared
            by apes as well. Williams et al. outlined evolutionary features,
            including in stem groupings, contrasted against the other primates
            such as the tarsiers and the lemuriformes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Monkeys range in size from the pygmy marmoset, which can be as small
            as 117 mm (4+5⁄8 in) with a 172 mm (6+3⁄4 in) tail and just over 100
            g (3+1⁄2 oz) in weight, to the male mandrill, almost 1 m (3 ft 3 in)
            long and weighing up to 36 kg (79 lb). Some are arboreal (living in
            trees) while others live on the savanna; diets differ among the
            various species but may contain any of the following: fruit, leaves,
            seeds, nuts, flowers, eggs and small animals (including insects and
            spiders).
          </p>
          <p>
            Some characteristics are shared among the groups; most New World
            monkeys have long tails, with those in the Atelidae family being
            prehensile, while Old World monkeys have non-prehensile tails or no
            visible tail at all. Old World monkeys have trichromatic color
            vision like that of humans, while New World monkeys may be
            trichromatic, dichromatic, or—as in the owl monkeys and greater
            galagos—monochromatic. Although both the New and Old World monkeys,
            like the apes, have forward-facing eyes, the faces of Old World and
            New World monkeys look very different, though again, each group
            shares some features such as the types of noses, cheeks and rumps.
