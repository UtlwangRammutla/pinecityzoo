          <h3>WARTHOGS</h3>
          <p>
            Although covered in bristly hairs, a warthog's body and head appear
            largely bare, from a distance, with only a crest of hair along the
            back and the tufts on the face and tail being obvious. The English
            name "wart"-hog refers to their facial wattles, which are
            particularly distinct in males. The males also have very prominent
            tusks, which reach a length of 10 to 25 inches (25 to 64
            centimetres); females' tusks are always smaller. They are largely
            herbivorous, but, like most suids, opportunistically eat
            invertebrates or small animals, even scavenging on carrion. While
            both species remain fairly common and widespread, and considered to
            be of Least Concern by the IUCN, the nominate subspecies of desert
            warthog, commonly known as the Cape warthog (P. a. aethiopicus) was
            extinct by around 1865.
